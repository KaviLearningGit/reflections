From the old files can do modifications to test some logic
If new modules implemented in new file and code goes haywire, old file helps to get back
easy to pinpoint typo error
If any bug occurs, the old version can be used to find the exact change , which leads to bug
pros of manual commit:
 The commit canbe done after adding the new features or resolving a bug
 cons:
  Sometimes we leave and it would become too big and sometime we may commit too often and would become too small
 pros of automatic commit:
  The commit would have at regular interval , so need to worry
 cons:
  We may not able to commit, ate necessary point or commits may happen at unnecessary point, where we would have done nothing.
 Saving multiple files would help , when u work on a project containing lot of files.
 Log command :
 can be used to see all commits, or to search for particular bug fix, feature added and updation made
 diff command :
 to compare code changes (above mentioned ) areas
 commit changes:
 knowing that i cant get back to old controls easily, i will have more confidence on experiments
