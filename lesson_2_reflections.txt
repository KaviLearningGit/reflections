When u initlize a repo, a .git directory will be created
The status of all the files and any commit details will be updated
If u add ur files in staging area and if u change your mind, udone it, and there will be no history in commits.
 if there is no staging area, u would be make uncessary changes or wrong commits
can add files to staging area, chect with original conent, to make sure coreect changes are made and then commit the changes from staging to comming (repo

Diagrams always help to think what goes beyond the scene
